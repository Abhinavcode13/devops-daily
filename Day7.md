- `git stash` - When we are working on one task, suddenly we may encounter any other priority task which has to be done first.
-  1. Usecase:
     - Manager assigned task-id : 101
     - Person A is working on task-id : 101 and suddenly manager call him to shift his work to another priority task which is task-id : 102
     - When manager asked to do task-id : 102 meanwhile task-id : 101 was partially completed and hence we can't push partial changes to repo because it may break current functionality.
     - Also we can't delete those implemented changes.
     - In this scenario we go for git stash option.
     - Git Stash is used to save working tree changes to temporary location and make working tree clean.
     - After priority work completed we can get stashed changes back using `$ git stash apply`.
