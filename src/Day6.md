## Repository Tools
### Working with Github
- Login into your github account with your credentials
- Create Repository in Github
- Note: Repository is used to store project source code. Every project will have one repository.
- When we create a repository, unique URL is generated with Repository name.
- All the employees will connect to repository using this URL.
- We can have 2 types repository in Github
  1. Public repository
  2. Private repository
- Public repository means everybody can access but we can choose who can modify the repository.
- Private repository means we will choose who can access and who can modify the repo.

  3. Create one file in repository folder : $ touch test.java
  4. Check status of file : $ git status
  5. Add file to staging area : $ git add .
  6. Commit file to git local epository : $ git commit -m 'commit-message'
  7. Push file from git local repo to git central repo : $ git push

  10. From this commit-id it will display first 7 characters in Github central repository.
