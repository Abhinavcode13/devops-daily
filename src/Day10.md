- Developers will use the `DEV` env for integration testing.Every developer will test their code in their dev environment.
- `SIT` env will be used for software testing team to test our application functionality. SIT stands for System Integration Testing
- `UAT` means User Acceptance Testing. UAT will be done by client and for client testing we will give UAT environment.
- In `PILOT` testing, a selected group of end users try the system under test and provide the feedback before the full deployment of the system.
- Pilot Testing is Important because it helps in many ways like `debugging software` and procedure used for testing.
