### Introduction

- Devops is culture/process which is used to collobrate development and operations in software project.
- Using Devops culture we can simplyfly software project delivery process to clients.
- Devops is used throughout software devlopment life cycle process.


We setup 2 teams for this Devops culture:
1. Development team
2. Operations team

- Development team is responsible for understanding the client requirements and based on the requirements team has to write the code and keep it in repository.
- Operations team setup the virual machines, setup servers, setup database, take code from repo, code build and package it, deploy code in server and deliver it to client.

### SDLC (Software development life cycle)

- The process of developing and delivering software project is called as SDlc
- In SDLC we have several phases
1. Requirements Gathering
2. Requirements Analysis
3. Design / Planning
4. Coding / Development / Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deploy
7. Deliver
8. Maintenence

### Waterfall Methodology

- Earlier people used to follow Waterfall Methodology to develop projects.
- Waterfall is a linear methodology to develop and deliver projects.
- Everything will happen step by step in linear fashion.
- It is unidirectional in nature.
- Requirements are fixed.
- Budget is fixed.
- Client will check the project at the end of completion.
- Client involvement is not there/very less in waterfall methodology.
- It is a outdated model.

### Agile Methodology

- It is a iterative approach.
- Development and testing will happen parallely.
- Client involvement is very high.
- Project is delivered in multiple releases.
- Requirements are not fixed.
- Budget is not fixed.
- For every release client will give a feedback.
- For example we have : 100 requirements out of this 30 requirements are on priority which has to be done first - After this 30 requirement => 40 requirements
- Every release is called as 1 sprint in agile methodology.
- It is bidirectional in nature.
- This methodology is currently most used in the tech market.
- Project development, testing and delivery is very frequent.
- DevOps is promoting Agile methodology.
- In DevOps we can achieve CI and CD by using agile methodology.

### DevOps Advantages

- Speed
- Automation
- Rapid development
- Teams colloboration
- Security
- Reliabilty
- Fast Releases
- Fast delivery
