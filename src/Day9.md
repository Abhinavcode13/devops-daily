## Git Pull
- `Git Pull` command is used to take latest changes from repository to local.
- When we want to make some changes to code, it is always recommended to take git pull.
- Git push command will be rejected if we dont Git pull the latest changes locally.
- We we do execute `git pull` there is a chance of getting `merge conflicts`. We need to resolve the conflicts and we should push the code without conflicts.
